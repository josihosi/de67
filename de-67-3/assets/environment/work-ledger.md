# DE-67 work ledger

DFS: `.de67/DFS.md`
Lineage: `<one stable project identity; the deadline database binds it on first task>`

Keep only the current batch, with at most ten still-red DFS claims. Each item names one mode:

- `Exploration` — one learning goal, the unknown premise, and evidence that will yield a strategy
  plus proof route.
- `Closure` — the known strategy and proof route, stable ids and current revisions for finite frozen
  gaps, and the next action expected to close or falsify exactly one active gap.

Keep only the present causal frontier, active route, material boundaries, claim-level item clock,
and current attempt id after dispatch. A retry receives a new task or attempt id without rebasing the
lineage, claim, item start, estimate, or deadline. A finding may reopen exploration but never
replaces that item identity or erases an attempt record. Delete an item when the outcome is accepted;
do not duplicate transcripts, chronological task history, or batch summaries here.

Every active item has exactly one indented pointer line containing one or more stable ids allocated
by `mutation_guard.py mark-dfs-slices`. Multiple ids preserve non-contiguous claim, acceptance, and
proof sections without loading the text between them. The markers remain in the DFS after
acceptance; deleting the active item removes only these live pointers.

## Active work

<!-- Example item: - [ ] R-001 — Closure: make the named owner perform the DFS transition. -->
<!-- Example pointer:   - DFS slices: `R-001-S001`, `R-001-S002` -->
