# Test and task guidelines

The headings in this document are frozen. Text beneath them is mutable after evidence-backed failure
review.

## Task preparation

Read the exact working tree, affected DFS claim, current owner path, relevant tests, and current tool
state. Choose the smallest task whose deletion would leave that claim unmet or unproven. Name real
dependencies and likely collision surfaces before parallel dispatch.

## Tooling check

Confirm the required tool, environment, command, and smallest runnable route before estimating or
dispatching. Treat setup uncertainty as work to resolve, not as invisible worker time.

## Task definition

Describe the desired outcome in natural language, bind it to one red DFS claim and the relevant code
surface, state material boundaries, and name the evidence that will decide acceptance. Do not demand
a fixed receipt shape.

## Worker and model selection

Use the weakest sufficient available worker for understood implementation. Use a stronger
implementation-capable model for ambiguous ownership, causal diagnosis, or risky cross-cutting work.
Change the route or worker only when evidence supports the change.

## Test definition

Define the smallest honest test that proves the DFS outcome through its authoritative owner. Include
negative controls only when they distinguish a real competing explanation. Do not substitute test
volume for coverage of the requested behavior.

## Test checking

The coordinator checks the actual diff, command result, and relevant artifact or observation. A test
passes only the claim it exercises. Preserve concise evidence paths; do not encode the same result in
nested receipts.

## Deadline estimation

Estimate from inspected scope, measured tooling/setup time, dependencies, and relevant prior tasks.
State the reason in the work ledger. The immutable timer begins at actual worker dispatch, and honest
late work still counts as a deadline miss.
